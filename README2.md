## Compile  `calib_ws`
Standard ROS workspace `catkin_make` procedure; 
```Shell
cd ~/WhereEver_You_Want
git clone https://github.com/lixiny/calib_ws.git 
cd calib_ws	
catkin_make
```

## Usage

#### 1.  Plug-In the Realsense Camera  & Open a Terminal 1: 
```Shell
cd calib_ws
source devel/setup.bash
roslaunch realsense2_driver realsense_driver.launch
```
when it shows the INFO like:   
<div align="center">
	<img src="doc/camera_info.png", width="400"> 
</div>

means the realsense2_driver is successfully tuned up. 

**Important**:  you should use the pop-up parameters:  **`###### camera_intrinsics ######`**  to update:
  `./calib_ws/src/handeye_calib_sphere/camera_intrinsic_color.xml` .
  
After `roslaunch`, you should have topics as blow in your terminal when you run:  `rostopic list`

#### 2. Prepare the Calibration Set-ups :
##### 2.1 A Shpere Model:
we use a 3D-printed hollow sphere model with Radius 75mm ( you can modify this radius if necessary).

##### 2.2 An Aruco Plate (not compulsory ):
we use RANSAC to localize the sphere inside the captured pointclouds.  instead to iterate from a full bunch of scatted points,  if we can use a aruco plate to segmente a region and make sure the points inside the region are all captured **on** the sphere,  RANSAC would be much easier( it should be ). 

The Aruco Plate is not compulsory again, you can de-activate the aruco module as described in `Advanced Usage` part.  

We use the aruco plate with 2 different size:


##### 2.3 Eye-in-hand Camera Mounting:
Till now, we only implement the eye-in-hand configration.  If you are familiar with the hand-eye problem, you can easily implement the eye-to-hand yourself.  
We use the hand-mounted camera viewing the Sphere-ArucoPlate setups as shown below.

##### 2.4 Gave a Initial Value

#### 3.  Tune up Robot, record the TFlink name of `base_link` and `end_link`  

we use UR5 and self-defined   [我还没写完]

#### 5.  Open another termianl 2:
```
cd calib_ws
source devel/setup.bash
